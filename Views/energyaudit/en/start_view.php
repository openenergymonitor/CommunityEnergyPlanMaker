<h2>Explore your energy picture</h2>

<p>With this tool you can explore your energy picture, how it compares to the average UK household energy use and how it relates to the Centre for Alternative Technologies Zero Carbon Britain 2030 energy scenario.</p>

<p>The results of your survey are then added to the results of everyone else signed up. Resulting in the creation of a community energy picture.</p>

<p>This process creates a solid foundataion for further work towards sustainable energy. It can help bring focus to areas and solutions that can have most impact and also give a tangible reference of progress so that milestones can be celebrated when achieved.</p>
